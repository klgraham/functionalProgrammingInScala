/** 
** Problem: place n queens on an n x n chessboard so that no queen is 
** threatened by another. In other words, there canâ€™t be two queens in 
** the same row, column, or diagonal.
** 
** Suppose that we have already generated all the solutions
** consisting of placing k-1 queens on a board of size n.
**
** Each solution is represented by a list (of length k-1) containing
** the numbers of columns (between 0 and n-1).
** 
** The column number of the queen in the k-1th row comes first in the list, 
** followed by the column number of the queen in row k-2, etc.
** e.g. List(col # of queen in k-1th row, col # of queen in k-2th row, ..., )
** 
** The solution set is thus represented as a set of lists, with one element for each solution.
** Now, to place the kth queen, we generate all possible extensions of each solution 
** preceded by a new queen:
